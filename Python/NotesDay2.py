Algorithm ==> is a step-by-step instructions lead to the desired outcome. 
    or/     is a set of finite, well-defined steps or instructions designed to solve a problem or perform a computation.

How to express an Algorithm?
1. Natural Language: Written in plain English. Easy to describe, but can be unclear for complex problems.
2. Flowchart: Graphical representation of steps. Easier to visualize than natural language.
3. Pseudocode: Text-based, code-like instructions without language syntax.

==> in python max() is an inbuilt function which can be used to find the maximum value present among all the numbers


How to analyse an Algo: 
1. Priori:- Evaluates the algorithm theoretically, without running it, assumes some factors as constant.
2. Posterior:- Evaluates the algorithm practically, by executing it, measure real performance and depends on hardware and compiler.

"""
List:- items are ordered, changable and allow duplicate values. The items are all indexed(0 to n).

To change order of list we have some specific built in methods such as:
1. append()	Adds an element at the end of the list
2. clear()	Removes all the elements from the list
3. copy()	Returns a copy of the list
4. count()	Returns the number of elements with the specified value
5. extend()	Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
6. index()	Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
7. insert()	Adds an element at the specified position
8. pop()	Removes the element at the specified position
9. remove()	Removes the item with the specified value
10. reverse()	Reverses the order of the list
11. sort()	Sorts the list
